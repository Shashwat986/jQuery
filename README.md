jQuery Practice
===============

This is basically a repo of the html files I made to practice jQuery. Please note that almost all of these files are horribly outdated, and are just efforts to learn how jquery works.

Files:
------

### autoopen.html

This tries to replicate an automatically expanding div.

### cross2.html

This creates a constant-sized div where images can fade in and fade out.

### divpaginate.html

This paginates the content of a div, dividing it at `<!--splittable-->` regions.

### draw2.html

This allows the user to drag (well, click) and drop an object.

### mice.html

This tried to replicate Google's April Fools 2012:

### mouseover3.html

This displays an image-tooltip on hovering over the highlighted text.

## scroll6.html

This creates an auto-scrolling list.
